# SIE ENG270 Prey Predator model for Lynxs and Hares

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to find a good approximation of data for Prey and Predator interactions, in order to be able to predict the future of both the populations.
This program will generate several csv files and plots representing the evolution of the populations of Preys and Predators in a 90-years simulation, also compared to the original data.

### Inputs and outputs

Inputs:
- data.csv 

Outputs:
- interpolated_data.csv (generated by the Python program "interpolation.py")
- parameters.txt (generated by the Python program "define_parameters.py")
- 3 models with different scenarios (generated by the C program "equations_solver.c")
- 5 graphs (generated by the python program "test.py")

All the outputs are given but are also generated by launching the program.

### Implementation details

Overview:
- The simulation is handled by C. The C program is compiled then communicates with Python via pipe.
- Python handles I/O. It pipes input values to the C program and then analyses the output piped out by C. Certain parameters are defined in the C program directly (they do not change throughout this study).
- Ultimately, Python produces the graphs.

Structure:
- interpolation.py:
    - interpolates the given populations data
    - takes data.csv as the input and generates interpolated_data.csv as output
- define_parameters.py:
    - finding the best initial parameters in order to fit the given data
    - takes interpolated_data.csv and generates parameters.txt
    - parameters.txt contains the 4 parameters needed in the C code.
- equations_solver.c:
    - receives values from parameters.txt
    - runs accordingly
    - generates 3 csv files:
      - model (with_peak_at_t=0)
      - model (with_peak_at_t=1883)
      - model (with_peak_at_t=1877)
- test.py:
    - generates plots starting from the 3 csv files.
    - it generates 5 plots.
- run.py
  It is the program necessary to reproduce the results.
